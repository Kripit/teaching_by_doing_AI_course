## 1. The Generalization Problem

### 1.1 What is Generalization?

**Generalization** = Model's ability to perform well on **unseen data**

**The fundamental goal of machine learning:**
```
Train on: 60,000 MNIST training images
Test on: 10,000 MNIST test images (never seen during training!)

Good model:
- Training accuracy: 99.2%
- Test accuracy: 98.9%  ✓ Generalizes well!

Bad model:
- Training accuracy: 99.9%
- Test accuracy: 85.3%  ✗ Overfitting!
```

### 1.2 The Bias-Variance Tradeoff

**Two sources of error:**

1. **Bias** = Error from wrong assumptions
   - Model is too simple to capture the true pattern
   - **Underfitting**: Model can't even fit training data well
   - Example: Linear model for non-linear data

2. **Variance** = Error from sensitivity to training data
   - Model is too complex and learns noise
   - **Overfitting**: Fits training data perfectly but fails on new data
   - Example: 100-layer network for simple task

**The tradeoff:**
```
Total Error = Bias² + Variance + Irreducible Noise

Simple model → High bias, Low variance (underfits)
Complex model → Low bias, High variance (overfits)
Sweet spot → Balanced bias and variance (generalizes!)
```

### 1.3 Why Neural Networks Overfit

**Neural networks are EXTREMELY powerful:**

- Can approximate **any function** (Universal Approximation Theorem)
- Have **millions of parameters** (more than training samples!)
- Can **memorize** the entire training set

**Example of memorization:**

Say you have 50,000 training images:
- Network with 10 million parameters
- Can assign unique "ID" to each image and memorize labels
- 100% training accuracy, but 10% test accuracy (random guessing!)

**This is why regularization is CRITICAL.**

## 2. Overfitting vs Underfitting

### 2.1 Visual Recognition

**Training vs Validation Loss Curves:**

```
Loss
  │
  │  Underfitting (High bias)
  │  ╱‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ Train loss (high)
  │ ╱
  │╱ ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ Val loss (high)
  └────────────────────→ Epochs
  
  Model: Too simple (1 hidden layer, 10 neurons)
  Both train and val loss are high
  Solution: Make model more complex
  
Loss
  │
  │  Good fit (Just right!)
  │  ╲
  │   ╲_______________  Train loss (low)
  │    ╲______________ Val loss (low, similar to train)
  └────────────────────→ Epochs
  
  Model: Appropriate complexity
  Train and val loss are both low and close
  Solution: This is what we want!
  
Loss
  │
  │  Overfitting (High variance)
  │  ╲
  │   ╲_______________  Train loss (very low)
  │    ╲
  │     ‾‾╲___________  Val loss (starts low, then increases!)
  └────────────────────→ Epochs
  
  Model: Too complex (20 layers, no regularization)
  Train loss keeps decreasing, but val loss increases
  Solution: Add regularization!
```

### 2.2 Detecting Overfitting

**Key signals:**

1. **Training vs Validation Gap**
   - Train accuracy: 99%
   - Val accuracy: 85%
   - Gap = 14% → **Overfitting!**

2. **Validation Loss Increases**
   - Epoch 10: Val loss = 0.5
   - Epoch 20: Val loss = 0.4
   - Epoch 30: Val loss = 0.6 ↑ **Overfitting started!**

3. **Model Complexity Indicators**
   - Too many layers for simple task
   - Very large weights (|w| > 100)
   - High training accuracy too quickly (epoch 2: 98%)

### 2.3 Detecting Underfitting

**Key signals:**

1. **Low Performance on Both**
   - Train accuracy: 65%
   - Val accuracy: 63%
   - Both are bad → **Underfitting!**

2. **Loss Plateaus Early**
   - Epoch 5: Loss = 1.2
   - Epoch 50: Loss = 1.1
   - Barely improving → Model can't learn

3. **Model Too Simple**
   - 1-layer network for complex image classification
   - Linear model for non-linear data

## 3. L1 and L2 Regularization

### 3.1 The Core Idea

**Add a penalty term to the loss function** that discourages large weights:

$$L_{total} = L_{data} + \lambda \cdot R(w)$$

**Breaking down EVERY symbol:**

- $L_{total}$ = **Total loss** to minimize (what we actually optimize)
  - Combines data loss and regularization penalty
  
- $=$ = **Assignment**

- $L_{data}$ = **Data loss** (original loss)
  - Cross-entropy, MSE, etc.
  - Measures how well model fits training data
  - Example: If predictions are perfect → $L_{data} = 0$
  
- $+$ = **Addition**

- $\lambda$ = **Regularization strength** (Greek letter "lambda")
  - Hyperparameter controlling tradeoff
  - Typical values: 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1
  - $\lambda = 0$ → no regularization
  - $\lambda$ large → strong regularization (simpler model)
  - Pronounced "lambda"
  
- $\cdot$ = **Multiplication**

- $R(w)$ = **Regularization term** (penalty function)
  - Measures "complexity" of weights
  - Different forms: L1, L2, elastic net
  - $w$ = all weights in the network

**Why this works:**

The optimizer now faces two competing objectives:
1. **Minimize $L_{data}$** → Fit the training data well
2. **Minimize $R(w)$** → Keep weights small

The parameter $\lambda$ controls the balance:
- If $\lambda$ is too small → Model overfits (ignores regularization)
- If $\lambda$ is too large → Model underfits (weights stay too small)

### 3.2 L2 Regularization (Weight Decay)

**Most popular regularization technique!**

$$R(w) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i} w_i^2 = \frac{1}{2} ||w||_2^2$$

**Breaking down EVERY symbol:**

- $R(w)$ = **L2 regularization term**
  - "L2" because it uses the L2 norm (Euclidean norm)
  - Also called "weight decay" or "ridge regression"
  
- $=$ = **Equals**

- $\frac{1}{2}$ = **Constant factor of 0.5**
  - Makes derivative cleaner: $\frac{d}{dw}(\frac{1}{2}w^2) = w$
  - Optional (can be absorbed into $\lambda$)
  
- $\sum_{i}$ = **Sum over all weights**
  - $i$ = index going through every weight in network
  - Includes weights from ALL layers
  - Does NOT include biases (typically)
  
- $w_i^2$ = **Squared weight value**
  - If $w_i = 3.0$ → $w_i^2 = 9.0$
  - If $w_i = -3.0$ → $w_i^2 = 9.0$ (same penalty!)
  - Always positive (can't cancel out)
  - Large weights penalized heavily (quadratic growth)
  
- $||w||_2^2$ = **Squared L2 norm** (alternative notation)
  - $||w||_2 = \sqrt{w_1^2 + w_2^2 + ... + w_n^2}$ (Euclidean length)
  - $||w||_2^2 = w_1^2 + w_2^2 + ... + w_n^2$ (squared length)
  - Same as $\sum_i w_i^2$

**Concrete numerical example:**

Say we have 4 weights: $w = [2.0, -1.5, 0.5, -3.0]$

L2 regularization term:

$$R(w) = \frac{1}{2}(2.0^2 + (-1.5)^2 + 0.5^2 + (-3.0)^2)$$

$$R(w) = \frac{1}{2}(4.0 + 2.25 + 0.25 + 9.0)$$

$$R(w) = \frac{1}{2}(15.5) = 7.75$$

If $\lambda = 0.01$:

$$\lambda \cdot R(w) = 0.01 \times 7.75 = 0.0775$$

This gets added to the data loss!

**Gradient of L2 regularization:**

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial w_i} \left(\frac{\lambda}{2} w_i^2\right) = \lambda w_i$$

**What this means for weight updates:**

Without regularization:

$$w_i := w_i - \eta \frac{\partial L_{data}}{\partial w_i}$$

With L2 regularization:

$$w_i := w_i - \eta \left(\frac{\partial L_{data}}{\partial w_i} + \lambda w_i\right)$$

Rearranging:

$$w_i := w_i(1 - \eta\lambda) - \eta \frac{\partial L_{data}}{\partial w_i}$$

The term $(1 - \eta\lambda)$ **shrinks the weight** every update!

**Concrete example of weight decay:**

Say $w = 5.0$, $\eta = 0.1$, $\lambda = 0.01$, gradient = 0

Without regularization:

$$w_{new} = 5.0 - 0.1 \times 0 = 5.0$$ (no change)

With L2 regularization:

$$w_{new} = 5.0 \times (1 - 0.1 \times 0.01) - 0 = 5.0 \times 0.999 = 4.995$$

Weight shrinks by 0.1% per update → "weight decay"!

**Why L2 regularization helps:**

1. **Prevents large weights**:
   - Large weights → sensitive to small input changes
   - Small weights → more robust
   
2. **Encourages weight sharing**:
   - Prefers many small weights over few large weights
   - Example: $w_1=5, w_2=5$ is better than $w_1=10, w_2=0$
   - $5^2 + 5^2 = 50$ < $10^2 + 0^2 = 100$
   
3. **Smoother decision boundaries**:
   - Smooth functions have small derivatives (weights)
   - Prevents fitting noise in training data

### 3.3 L1 Regularization (Lasso)

$$R(w) = \sum_{i} |w_i| = ||w||_1$$

**Breaking down EVERY symbol:**

- $R(w)$ = **L1 regularization term**
  - "L1" because it uses L1 norm (Manhattan distance)
  - Also called "Lasso" (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator)
  
- $=$ = **Equals**

- $\sum_i$ = **Sum over all weights**
  - Goes through every weight in the network
  
- $|w_i|$ = **Absolute value** of weight
  - If $w_i = 3.0$ → $|w_i| = 3.0$
  - If $w_i = -3.0$ → $|w_i| = 3.0$
  - Always positive
  - Linear growth (not quadratic like L2!)
  
- $||w||_1$ = **L1 norm** (alternative notation)
  - Sum of absolute values
  - Also called "Manhattan distance" or "taxicab distance"

**Concrete numerical example:**

Same weights as before: $w = [2.0, -1.5, 0.5, -3.0]$

L1 regularization term:

$$R(w) = |2.0| + |-1.5| + |0.5| + |-3.0|$$

$$R(w) = 2.0 + 1.5 + 0.5 + 3.0 = 7.0$$

Compare to L2: $R(w) = 7.75$ (L1 is smaller for these weights)

**Gradient of L1 regularization:**

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial w_i} (\lambda |w_i|) = \lambda \cdot \text{sign}(w_i)$$

Where $\text{sign}(w_i) = \begin{cases} +1 & \text{if } w_i > 0 \\ -1 & \text{if } w_i < 0 \\ 0 & \text{if } w_i = 0 \end{cases}$

**What this means:**

The gradient is **constant** (±$\lambda$), not proportional to weight size!

Weight update with L1:

$$w_i := w_i - \eta(\frac{\partial L_{data}}{\partial w_i} + \lambda \cdot \text{sign}(w_i))$$

**Concrete example:**

Say $w = 5.0$, $\eta = 0.1$, $\lambda = 0.01$, gradient = 0

With L1 regularization:

$$w_{new} = 5.0 - 0.1 \times (0 + 0.01 \times 1) = 5.0 - 0.001 = 4.999$$

Weight shrinks by **fixed amount** (0.001), not percentage!

**Key difference: L1 vs L2**

For large weight ($w = 10$):
- L2: Shrinks by $\eta \lambda w = 0.1 \times 0.01 \times 10 = 0.01$ (large)
- L1: Shrinks by $\eta \lambda = 0.1 \times 0.01 = 0.001$ (fixed)

For small weight ($w = 0.1$):
- L2: Shrinks by $0.1 \times 0.01 \times 0.1 = 0.0001$ (tiny)
- L1: Shrinks by $0.1 \times 0.01 = 0.001$ (same as before!)

**Result: L1 drives small weights to exactly zero → Sparsity!**

### 3.4 L1 vs L2: When to Use Which?

| Aspect | L2 (Ridge) | L1 (Lasso) |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Penalty** | Squared weights: $w^2$ | Absolute weights: $\|w\|$ |
| **Effect on large weights** | Heavy penalty (quadratic) | Moderate penalty (linear) |
| **Effect on small weights** | Light penalty | Same penalty as large weights |
| **Sparsity** | No (weights near zero) | Yes (many weights = 0) |
| **Feature selection** | No | Yes (zeros out features) |
| **Solution** | Smooth, all weights small | Sparse, some weights = 0 |
| **Gradient** | Proportional to weight | Constant (±$\lambda$) |
| **Use case** | Default choice | When you need feature selection |
| **Computational** | Closed-form solution | Requires iterative solver |

**Visual comparison:**

```
L2 penalty grows quadratically:
Penalty
   │         ╱
   │       ╱
   │     ╱
   │   ╱
   │ ╱
   └────────→ |w|
   
L1 penalty grows linearly:
Penalty
   │       ╱
   │     ╱
   │   ╱
   │ ╱
   └────────→ |w|
```

**Geometric intuition:**

In 2D weight space ($w_1, w_2$):

L2 constraint: $w_1^2 + w_2^2 \leq C$ (circle)
- Weights can be non-zero in any direction
- Smooth optimization

L1 constraint: $|w_1| + |w_2| \leq C$ (diamond)
- Diamond has corners on axes ($w_1=0$ or $w_2=0$)
- Optimization likely hits corners → sparsity!

**Practical recommendation:**

- **Start with L2** (default choice, works 95% of time)
- **Use L1** when:
  - You have many features and want automatic selection
  - You need interpretable models (which features matter?)
  - You want to reduce model size (sparse networks)

### 3.5 Elastic Net (L1 + L2)

Combines both penalties:

$$R(w) = \lambda_1 \sum_i |w_i| + \lambda_2 \sum_i w_i^2$$

**Breaking down:**

- $\lambda_1$ = L1 regularization strength
- $\lambda_2$ = L2 regularization strength
- Gets benefits of both: sparsity + smoothness

**When to use:**
- High-dimensional data with correlated features
- Want some sparsity but also stability of L2
- Have time to tune two hyperparameters

## 4. Dropout

### 4.1 The Core Idea

**Randomly "drop" (set to zero) neurons during training**

Invented by Hinton et al. (2012) - revolutionized deep learning!

**Algorithm:**

During training (forward pass):
1. For each neuron in a layer
2. With probability $p$ (dropout rate), set output to 0
3. With probability $(1-p)$, keep the neuron active
4. Scale remaining activations by $\frac{1}{1-p}$

During testing:
- **Use all neurons** (no dropout)
- No scaling needed (due to training-time scaling)

**Mathematical formulation:**

Training:

$$a^{[l]} = \text{activation}(z^{[l]}) \odot m^{[l]} \cdot \frac{1}{1-p}$$

**Breaking down EVERY symbol:**

- $a^{[l]}$ = **Activation output** from layer l with dropout
  - This is what gets passed to next layer
  
- $=$ = **Assignment**

- $\text{activation}(z^{[l]})$ = **Regular activation** (ReLU, sigmoid, etc.)
  - $z^{[l]}$ = pre-activation (weighted sum)
  - This is computed normally first
  
- $\odot$ = **Element-wise multiplication** (Hadamard product)
  - Multiply corresponding elements
  - Example: $[1, 2, 3] \odot [1, 0, 1] = [1, 0, 3]$
  
- $m^{[l]}$ = **Dropout mask** (binary random vector)
  - Shape: Same as activation
  - Each element is 0 or 1
  - Generated randomly for each forward pass!
  - $m_i = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{with probability } p \text{ (drop)} \\ 1 & \text{with probability } 1-p \text{ (keep)} \end{cases}$
  
- $\cdot \frac{1}{1-p}$ = **Inverted dropout scaling**
  - Compensates for dropped neurons
  - If $p = 0.5$ → scale by $\frac{1}{0.5} = 2$
  - Ensures expected value stays the same

**Why the scaling factor?**

Without scaling:
- Training: Average activation = $(1-p) \times a$ (some neurons dropped)
- Testing: Average activation = $a$ (all neurons active)
- Mismatch! Network behaves differently!

With scaling by $\frac{1}{1-p}$:
- Training: Average = $(1-p) \times a \times \frac{1}{1-p} = a$ ✓
- Testing: Average = $a$ ✓
- Consistent!

**Concrete numerical example:**

Say we have activations: $a = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]$, $p = 0.5$ (drop 50%)

Step 1: Generate random mask
- $m = [1, 0, 1, 0]$ (randomly dropped 2nd and 4th neurons)

Step 2: Apply mask
- $a \odot m = [1.0, 0, 3.0, 0]$

Step 3: Scale by $\frac{1}{1-p} = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2$
- $a_{final} = [2.0, 0, 6.0, 0]$

Original sum: $1+2+3+4 = 10$
After dropout: $2+0+6+0 = 8$ (close to 10 on average!)

### 4.2 Why Dropout Works

**Multiple explanations:**

**1. Ensemble of networks:**
- Each dropout pattern creates a different "sub-network"
- With $n$ neurons, there are $2^n$ possible sub-networks!
- Training with dropout = training ensemble of $2^n$ networks
- At test time: averaging predictions (model averaging)
- Ensembles always generalize better

**2. Reduces co-adaptation:**
- Without dropout: Neurons can "collaborate" too much
  - Neuron A learns to detect "eyes"
  - Neuron B learns "face ONLY if neuron A fires"
  - Too specialized, fragile!
- With dropout: Neuron B can't rely on neuron A (might be dropped!)
  - Each neuron must learn useful features independently
  - More robust representations

**3. Implicit data augmentation:**
- Each forward pass sees a different sub-network
- It's like training on different "versions" of the data
- Adds noise → forces learning of robust features

**4. Bayesian interpretation:**
- Dropout ≈ approximate Bayesian inference
- Each sub-network is a sample from posterior distribution
- Captures model uncertainty

### 4.3 Dropout Hyperparameters

**Dropout rate ($p$):**

| Layer Type | Typical $p$ | Reason |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Input layer | 0.0 - 0.2 | Don't drop too much raw data |
| Hidden layers | 0.3 - 0.5 | Standard choice |
| Large hidden layers | 0.5 - 0.7 | More neurons → can drop more |
| Output layer | 0.0 | Never drop outputs! |

**Common values:**
- $p = 0.5$ → Drop 50% of neurons (most popular)
- $p = 0.3$ → Drop 30% (conservative)
- $p = 0.7$ → Drop 70% (aggressive, for very wide networks)

**Tuning strategy:**
1. Start with $p = 0.5$ for hidden layers
2. If still overfitting → increase to 0.6 or 0.7
3. If underfitting → decrease to 0.3 or remove dropout

### 4.4 Implementing Dropout

**Training mode:**

```python
# Forward pass with dropout
def forward_with_dropout(X, W, p=0.5):
    # Compute activations normally
    a = relu(X @ W)  # Shape: (batch_size, neurons)
    
    # Generate dropout mask
    # Each element is 1 with probability (1-p), else 0
    mask = np.random.binomial(1, 1-p, size=a.shape)
    
    # Apply mask and scale
    a_dropout = a * mask / (1-p)
    
    # Store mask for backward pass
    return a_dropout, mask
```

**Test mode:**

```python
# Forward pass at test time (no dropout)
def forward_test(X, W):
    a = relu(X @ W)
    # Use all neurons, no scaling needed!
    return a
```

**Backward pass:**

The gradient only flows through neurons that weren't dropped:

```python
def backward_with_dropout(da, mask, p=0.5):
    # Gradient only flows through active neurons
    # Apply same mask and scaling
    da_prev = da * mask / (1-p)
    return da_prev
```

**Implementation note:** In modern frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow):

```python
# PyTorch
self.dropout = nn.Dropout(p=0.5)

# Training mode
self.train()  # Enables dropout
output = self.dropout(x)

# Test mode
self.eval()  # Disables dropout
output = self.dropout(x)  # No dropout applied
```

### 4.5 Where to Apply Dropout

**Recommended:**

1. **Fully connected (dense) layers**
   - Most common use case
   - Apply after activation function
   - Typical: $p = 0.5$

2. **Between CNN layers (use sparingly)**
   - CNNs already have strong spatial regularization
   - If needed: $p = 0.1$ to $0.3$
   - Modern practice: Use batch norm instead

3. **After RNN/LSTM outputs**
   - NOT on recurrent connections (breaks temporal dynamics)
   - Apply to output projections only
   - Typical: $p = 0.3$ to $0.5$

**NOT recommended:**

- ❌ Input layer (use $p \leq 0.2$ if needed)
- ❌ Output layer (never!)
- ❌ Batch norm layers (they regularize differently)
- ❌ Very small networks (dropout needs redundancy)

### 4.6 Dropout Variations

**DropConnect:**
- Instead of dropping neurons, drop individual **weights**
- $W_{dropout} = W \odot M$ where $M$ is binary mask
- More fine-grained than dropout

**Spatial Dropout (2D):**
- For CNNs: Drop entire feature maps, not individual pixels
- Preserves spatial structure
- Better for convolutional layers

**Concrete Dropout:**
- Learns optimal dropout rate automatically
- Uses Bayesian optimization
- More principled but complex

## 5. Batch Normalization

### 5.1 The Internal Covariate Shift Problem

**The problem:** During training, layer inputs' distributions keep changing!

Imagine Layer 2 in a network:
- Epoch 1: Receives inputs in range [-1, 1]
- Epoch 10: Receives inputs in range [-5, 5] (due to Layer 1's weight updates)
- Epoch 20: Receives inputs in range [-0.1, 0.1]

Each layer must constantly adapt to changing input distributions!

**Consequences:**
1. **Slow training**: Layers keep "chasing" moving targets
2. **Requires small learning rates**: Prevent instability
3. **Sensitive to initialization**: Bad init → bad distributions → slow learning
4. **Vanishing/exploding gradients**: Distributions can go to extremes

**Solution: Batch Normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015)**

Normalize layer inputs to have **consistent** mean and variance!

### 5.2 Batch Normalization Algorithm

**Applied to mini-batch of activations** $X = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_m\}$

**Step 1: Compute batch statistics**

$$\mu_B = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i$$

**Breaking down:**

- $\mu_B$ = **Batch mean** (Greek letter "mu")
  - Average of all activations in the batch
  - $B$ subscript = "batch"
  - Computed per feature dimension
  
- $\frac{1}{m}$ = **Average** over batch size $m$

- $\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i$ = **Sum** of all samples in batch
  - $i$ = sample index (1, 2, ..., m)

$$\sigma_B^2 = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (x_i - \mu_B)^2$$

**Breaking down:**

- $\sigma_B^2$ = **Batch variance** (Greek letter "sigma" squared)
  - Measures spread of activations
  - $^2$ = squared (variance, not standard deviation)
  
- $(x_i - \mu_B)^2$ = **Squared deviation** from mean
  - How far is sample $i$ from average?
  - Squared to make positive
  - Large variance → values spread out

**Step 2: Normalize**

$$\hat{x}_i = \frac{x_i - \mu_B}{\sqrt{\sigma_B^2 + \epsilon}}$$

**Breaking down EVERY symbol:**

- $\hat{x}_i$ = **Normalized activation** for sample $i$
  - Hat (^) indicates normalized
  - This is what we pass to next layer (after step 3)
  
- $=$ = **Equals**

- $x_i - \mu_B$ = **Center** the activation (subtract mean)
  - Shifts distribution to have mean = 0
  - If $\mu_B = 5$ and $x_i = 8$ → $x_i - \mu_B = 3$
  
- $\div$ = **Division**

- $\sqrt{\sigma_B^2 + \epsilon}$ = **Standard deviation** (with stability term)
  - $\sqrt{\sigma_B^2}$ = $\sigma_B$ = standard deviation
  - $\epsilon$ = tiny constant (1e-5) to prevent division by zero
  - If $\sigma_B = 2$ and $\sigma_B^2 = 4$, then $\sqrt{4 + 10^{-5}} \approx 2$
  
After this step: $\hat{x}_i$ has mean ≈ 0, variance ≈ 1 (standard normal!)

**Step 3: Scale and shift**

$$y_i = \gamma \hat{x}_i + \beta$$

**Breaking down EVERY symbol:**

- $y_i$ = **Final output** after batch norm
  - This is what actually gets passed to next layer
  - No hat (^) = not normalized anymore!
  
- $=$ = **Equals**

- $\gamma$ = **Scale parameter** (Greek letter "gamma")
  - **Learnable parameter** (trained via backprop!)
  - Allows network to "undo" normalization if needed
  - Initialized to 1
  - Shape: (num_features,) - one per feature dimension
  
- $\hat{x}_i$ = **Normalized activation** from step 2

- $+$ = **Addition**

- $\beta$ = **Shift parameter** (Greek letter "beta")
  - **Learnable parameter** (trained via backprop!)
  - Allows network to shift mean if needed
  - Initialized to 0
  - Shape: (num_features,) - one per feature dimension

**Why scale and shift?**

Normalization forces mean=0, var=1, but maybe the network **wants** different values!

- If optimal mean is 5 and variance is 4:
  - Network can learn $\gamma = 2$ and $\beta = 5$
  - Then $y = 2 \hat{x} + 5$ recovers desired distribution
  
- Special case: $\gamma = \sigma_B$ and $\beta = \mu_B$ → recovers original input!
  - Network can "undo" batch norm if it's not helpful

### 5.3 Concrete Numerical Example

Say we have batch of 4 samples (after activation):

$$X = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 5 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix}$$

**Step 1: Compute batch statistics**

Batch mean:

$$\mu_B = \frac{1}{4}(1 + 3 + 5 + 7) = \frac{16}{4} = 4$$

Batch variance:

$$\sigma_B^2 = \frac{1}{4}[(1-4)^2 + (3-4)^2 + (5-4)^2 + (7-4)^2]$$

$$= \frac{1}{4}[9 + 1 + 1 + 9] = \frac{20}{4} = 5$$

Standard deviation:

$$\sigma_B = \sqrt{5 + 10^{-5}} \approx 2.236$$

**Step 2: Normalize**

$$\hat{x}_1 = \frac{1 - 4}{2.236} = \frac{-3}{2.236} = -1.342$$

$$\hat{x}_2 = \frac{3 - 4}{2.236} = \frac{-1}{2.236} = -0.447$$

$$\hat{x}_3 = \frac{5 - 4}{2.236} = \frac{1}{2.236} = 0.447$$

$$\hat{x}_4 = \frac{7 - 4}{2.236} = \frac{3}{2.236} = 1.342$$

Check: $\hat{X} = [-1.342, -0.447, 0.447, 1.342]$
- Mean ≈ 0 ✓
- Variance ≈ 1 ✓

**Step 3: Scale and shift**

Say $\gamma = 2.0$ and $\beta = 1.0$ (learned parameters):

$$y_1 = 2.0 \times (-1.342) + 1.0 = -2.684 + 1.0 = -1.684$$

$$y_2 = 2.0 \times (-0.447) + 1.0 = -0.894 + 1.0 = 0.106$$

$$y_3 = 2.0 \times (0.447) + 1.0 = 0.894 + 1.0 = 1.894$$

$$y_4 = 2.0 \times (1.342) + 1.0 = 2.684 + 1.0 = 3.684$$

Final output: $Y = [-1.684, 0.106, 1.894, 3.684]$

This output has mean ≈ 1 and std ≈ 2 (controlled by $\beta$ and $\gamma$!)

### 5.4 Batch Norm at Test Time

**Problem:** At test time, we might have single sample (batch size = 1)!

Can't compute meaningful mean/variance from one sample.

**Solution:** Use **running statistics** from training:

During training:
- Keep **exponential moving average** of batch means and variances
- $\mu_{running} = \alpha \mu_{running} + (1-\alpha) \mu_B$
- $\sigma_{running}^2 = \alpha \sigma_{running}^2 + (1-\alpha) \sigma_B^2$
- Typical $\alpha = 0.9$ or $0.99$

At test time:
- Use $\mu_{running}$ and $\sigma_{running}$ instead of batch statistics
- Normalize: $\hat{x} = \frac{x - \mu_{running}}{\sqrt{\sigma_{running}^2 + \epsilon}}$
- Scale and shift: $y = \gamma \hat{x} + \beta$

### 5.5 Why Batch Normalization Works

**Multiple benefits:**

**1. Reduces internal covariate shift:**
- Layer inputs have consistent distributions
- Each layer trains faster (doesn't chase moving target)

**2. Acts as regularization:**
- Batch statistics add noise (different for each batch)
- Similar to dropout but less aggressive
- Can reduce/remove dropout when using batch norm

**3. Allows higher learning rates:**
- Normalization prevents exploding activations/gradients
- Can use 10-100x larger learning rates
- Faster convergence!

**4. Reduces sensitivity to initialization:**
- Even with bad init, batch norm normalizes activations
- Xavier/He initialization less critical

**5. Smoother optimization landscape:**
- Loss function becomes more "well-behaved"
- Fewer sharp minima, easier to optimize

**Empirical results:**
- ImageNet training: 14x faster convergence
- Can achieve same accuracy with fewer epochs
- Enabled training of very deep networks (100+ layers)

### 5.6 Where to Apply Batch Norm

**Standard placement:**

```
Linear → BatchNorm → Activation → (Dropout)
```

or

```
Linear → Activation → BatchNorm → (Dropout)
```

**Both work, but convention:**
- **Before activation** (original paper)
  - Normalize the pre-activations $z$
  - Most common in practice
  
- **After activation** (also works)
  - Normalize the post-activations $a$
  - Some empirical advantages in certain cases

**Full network example:**

```
Input (784)
   ↓
Dense(784 → 256)
   ↓
BatchNorm(256)  ← Normalize!
   ↓
ReLU
   ↓
Dense(256 → 128)
   ↓
BatchNorm(128)  ← Normalize!
   ↓
ReLU
   ↓
Dense(128 → 10)
   ↓
Softmax (NO batch norm on output!)
```

**Important notes:**

- ❌ Don't use on output layer
- ❌ Don't use with very small batch sizes (<8)
- ✅ Use with medium/large batch sizes (32+)
- ✅ Especially helpful in deep networks (5+ layers)

### 5.7 Batch Norm Hyperparameters

**Momentum ($\alpha$):**
- For running statistics: $\mu_{running} = \alpha \mu_{running} + (1-\alpha) \mu_B$
- Typical: 0.9 or 0.99
- Higher = more history retained

**Epsilon ($\epsilon$):**
- Numerical stability in normalization
- Typical: 1e-5 or 1e-8
- Prevents division by zero

**These are usually left at defaults - no tuning needed!**

## 6. Early Stopping

### 6.1 The Concept

**Stop training when validation performance stops improving**

Simple but effective regularization technique!

**Algorithm:**

1. Train model and track validation loss/accuracy
2. Save model checkpoint when validation improves
3. If validation doesn't improve for $n$ epochs (patience), stop training
4. Restore best checkpoint

**Visual:**

```
Val Loss
  │
  │  ●                     ← Best model (epoch 15)
  │   ●
  │    ●●
  │      ●●●
  │         ●●●●●   ← Stop here (epoch 25)
  │              ●●●  Patience = 10 epochs
  │                 ●
  └────────────────────────→ Epoch
  1        15      25    30

Training stops at epoch 25, but we restore model from epoch 15!
```

### 6.2 Implementation

**Pseudocode:**

```python
best_val_loss = infinity
patience = 10
counter = 0
best_model = None

for epoch in range(max_epochs):
    train_loss = train_one_epoch()
    val_loss = validate()
    
    # Check if validation improved
    if val_loss < best_val_loss:
        best_val_loss = val_loss
        best_model = copy_model()  # Save checkpoint
        counter = 0  # Reset patience counter
    else:
        counter += 1  # No improvement
    
    # Check if patience exceeded
    if counter >= patience:
        print(f"Early stopping at epoch {epoch}")
        break

# Restore best model
model = best_model
```

### 6.3 Early Stopping Hyperparameters

**Patience:**
- How many epochs to wait for improvement
- **Too small** (5): Might stop too early, underfit
- **Too large** (100): Wastes time, overfits
- **Typical values:** 10-20 for small datasets, 30-50 for large

**Min delta:**
- Minimum improvement to count as "better"
- Prevents stopping due to tiny fluctuations
- Typical: 0.001 or 0.0001
- Example: Only count as improvement if val_loss decreases by >0.001

**Metric to monitor:**
- Validation loss (most common)
- Validation accuracy (for classification)
- Custom metrics (F1, AUC, etc.)

### 6.4 Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**

✅ **Simple**: Easy to implement
✅ **No hyperparameters**: Only patience (vs L2 λ, dropout p)
✅ **Automatic**: Determines when to stop
✅ **Efficient**: Doesn't waste time overtraining
✅ **Often works**: Effective regularization

**Disadvantages:**

❌ **Requires validation set**: Needs held-out data
❌ **Noisy validation**: Might stop too early due to noise
❌ **Longer training**: Must train until overfitting appears
❌ **Not suitable for small datasets**: High variance in val metrics

**Best practice:** Combine with other regularization!
- L2 + Early Stopping
- Dropout + Batch Norm + Early Stopping

## 7. Data Augmentation

### 7.1 The Concept

**Artificially expand training data** by applying transformations

Core idea: Create "new" training samples from existing ones!

**For images:**
- Flip horizontally
- Rotate ±15°
- Zoom in/out
- Add noise
- Adjust brightness/contrast
- Random crops

**Example:**

Original cat image → 10 augmented versions:
1. Original
2. Flipped horizontally
3. Rotated 10° clockwise
4. Rotated 10° counter-clockwise
5. Zoomed in 10%
6. Brightness +20%
7. Brightness -20%
8. Random crop (top-left)
9. Random crop (bottom-right)
10. Combination of above

Effective dataset size: 10x larger!

### 7.2 Image Augmentation Techniques

**Geometric transformations:**

1. **Horizontal flip**
   - Mirror image left-right
   - Use case: Objects look same flipped (cats, cars)
   - Don't use: Text, digits (3 ≠ Ɛ)

2. **Rotation**
   - Rotate ±15° to ±45°
   - Use case: Object orientation doesn't matter
   - Don't use: Upright objects (people, buildings)

3. **Translation**
   - Shift image left/right/up/down
   - Simulates different camera positions

4. **Scaling/Zoom**
   - Zoom in (crop) or out (pad)
   - Simulates different distances

5. **Shearing**
   - Skew image perspective
   - Simulates viewing angle changes

**Color transformations:**

1. **Brightness**
   - Multiply pixels by constant: $x_{new} = \alpha x$
   - Simulates different lighting

2. **Contrast**
   - Stretch/compress pixel range
   - $x_{new} = 128 + \alpha(x - 128)$

3. **Saturation**
   - Adjust color intensity
   - Grayscale ↔ Vivid colors

4. **Hue shift**
   - Rotate colors (red → green → blue → red)

**Noise and corruption:**

1. **Gaussian noise**
   - Add random noise: $x_{new} = x + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$

2. **Salt and pepper**
   - Random black/white pixels

3. **Cutout/Random erasing**
   - Black out random rectangular regions
   - Forces network to use context

### 7.3 Implementation Example (PyTorch)

```python
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

# Define augmentation pipeline
train_transform = transforms.Compose([
    # Resize to standard size
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    
    # Random augmentations
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),  # 50% chance flip
    transforms.RandomRotation(degrees=15),    # ±15° rotation
    transforms.ColorJitter(
        brightness=0.2,  # ±20% brightness
        contrast=0.2,    # ±20% contrast
        saturation=0.2,  # ±20% saturation
        hue=0.1          # ±10% hue
    ),
    transforms.RandomCrop(224, padding=4),   # Random crop
    
    # Convert to tensor and normalize
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(
        mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],  # ImageNet statistics
        std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    )
])

# For test/validation: NO augmentation (except resize/normalize)
test_transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(
        mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
        std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    )
])
```

### 7.4 Domain-Specific Augmentation

**Computer vision:**
- All techniques above
- Mixup: Blend two images
- CutMix: Paste crop from one image onto another

**Natural language processing:**
- Synonym replacement
- Random insertion/deletion
- Back-translation (translate to French, then back to English)
- Word embedding perturbation

**Audio:**
- Time stretching
- Pitch shifting
- Add background noise
- Change speed

**Time series:**
- Time warping
- Magnitude warping
- Jittering

### 7.5 How Much Augmentation?

**Guidelines:**

**Light augmentation (good starting point):**
- Horizontal flip: 50%
- Rotation: ±10°
- Brightness/contrast: ±10%

**Medium augmentation (standard):**
- Horizontal flip: 50%
- Rotation: ±15°
- Zoom: 0.9-1.1x
- Brightness/contrast: ±20%

**Heavy augmentation (aggressive):**
- All geometric transforms
- All color transforms
- Cutout/mixup
- Risk: Too much → hurts performance

**Rule of thumb:**
- Small dataset (<10k samples) → Aggressive augmentation
- Large dataset (>100k samples) → Light augmentation
- If overfitting → Increase augmentation
- If underfitting → Decrease augmentation

## 8. Other Regularization Techniques

### 8.1 Label Smoothing

Instead of hard targets (0 or 1), use soft targets:

Hard: $y = [0, 0, 1, 0]$ (class 2)
Soft: $y = [0.025, 0.025, 0.925, 0.025]$ (mostly class 2)

**Formula:**

$$y_{smooth} = (1 - \epsilon) y + \frac{\epsilon}{K}$$

Where:
- $\epsilon$ = smoothing parameter (typically 0.1)
- $K$ = number of classes
- Prevents overconfidence

### 8.2 Mixup

Train on **blended images and labels**:

$$x_{mix} = \lambda x_i + (1-\lambda) x_j$$

$$y_{mix} = \lambda y_i + (1-\lambda) y_j$$

Where $\lambda \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \alpha)$, typically $\alpha = 0.2$

Forces smooth decision boundaries!

### 8.3 Gradient Clipping

**Prevents exploding gradients** by capping gradient magnitude:

$$g_{clipped} = \begin{cases}
g & \text{if } ||g|| \leq \theta \\
\frac{\theta \cdot g}{||g||} & \text{if } ||g|| > \theta
\end{cases}$$

Where $\theta$ is the threshold (e.g., 1.0 or 5.0)

### 8.4 Weight Constraints

**Max norm constraint:**

After each update, if $||w|| > c$, rescale: $w := \frac{c \cdot w}{||w||}$

Commonly used with dropout in RNNs.

---

## 9. Practical Guidelines

### 9.1 Regularization Strategy

**Step-by-step approach:**

**Step 1: Establish baseline**
- Train without regularization
- Observe: overfitting? underfitting?

**Step 2: If overfitting (train >> val):**
1. Add L2 regularization (λ = 0.001)
2. Add dropout (p = 0.5) to large layers
3. Add batch normalization
4. Implement early stopping (patience = 10-20)
5. Use data augmentation (if applicable)

**Step 3: If underfitting (both train and val poor):**
- Make model larger (more layers/neurons)
- Train longer
- Reduce regularization
- Check learning rate (might be too small)

**Step 4: Fine-tune hyperparameters:**
- Adjust L2 λ: try [0.0001, 0.001, 0.01]
- Adjust dropout p: try [0.3, 0.5, 0.7]
- Adjust early stopping patience

### 9.2 Which Regularization to Use?

**Default recipe (works 90% of time):**

```python
model = Sequential([
    Dense(512),
    BatchNorm(),      # ← Almost always helps
    ReLU(),
    Dropout(0.5),     # ← If overfitting
    
    Dense(256),
    BatchNorm(),
    ReLU(),
    Dropout(0.5),
    
    Dense(num_classes)
])

optimizer = Adam(lr=0.001, weight_decay=0.0001)  # ← L2 regularization

# During training
use_data_augmentation()  # ← If images
use_early_stopping(patience=20)
```

**Prioritization:**

1. **Batch Normalization** - Always try first
2. **Data Augmentation** - Free performance boost (images)
3. **L2 Regularization** - Simple, effective
4. **Dropout** - If still overfitting after above
5. **Early Stopping** - Safety net

### 9.3 Hyperparameter Tuning

**L2 regularization (λ):**
- Start: 0.001
- Too much overfitting → increase to 0.01
- Underfitting → decrease to 0.0001 or remove

**Dropout rate (p):**
- Start: 0.5 (drop 50%)
- Still overfitting → increase to 0.6-0.7
- Underfitting → decrease to 0.3 or remove

**Batch norm momentum:**
- Default: 0.9 or 0.99
- Usually no need to change

**Early stopping patience:**
- Small dataset: 10-20 epochs
- Large dataset: 20-50 epochs
- Noisy validation: Increase patience

### 9.4 Common Mistakes

**❌ Mistake 1: Too much regularization**
- Symptom: Poor training AND validation accuracy
- Solution: Reduce regularization strength

**❌ Mistake 2: Regularizing the output layer**
- Never use dropout on output neurons!
- Biases can be regularized or not (convention: not)

**❌ Mistake 3: Using batch norm with small batches**
- Batch size < 8 → unreliable statistics
- Solution: Use larger batches or remove batch norm

**❌ Mistake 4: Forgetting to disable augmentation at test time**
- Augmentation is for training only!
- Test images should be clean

**❌ Mistake 5: Not using early stopping**
- Wastes compute by overtraining
- Always monitor validation loss!
