## 1. The Learning Problem

### 1.1 What is Learning?

In Chapter 01, we built a neural network that could make predictions. But we didn't have a way to **improve** those predictions systematically.

**Learning** = Finding the best weights that minimize the loss function

**The Challenge**:
- Modern neural networks have **millions of parameters** (weights and biases)
- We need to find the "best" values for all of them
- The loss function is highly non-convex (many local minima)

**Example**: A simple 2-layer network for MNIST
```
Weights:
- Layer 1: 784 × 128 = 100,352 weights
- Layer 2: 128 × 10 = 1,280 weights
Total: 101,632 parameters to optimize!
```

### 1.2 Random Search (Doesn't Work!)

**Naive Approach**: Try random weights and keep the best

```python
best_loss = infinity
best_weights = None

for i in range(1_000_000_000):
    # Generate random weights
    random_weights = random()
    
    # Compute loss
    loss = evaluate(random_weights, data)
    
    # Keep if better
    if loss < best_loss:
        best_loss = loss
        best_weights = random_weights
```

**Why This Fails**:
- Search space is **astronomical** (10^100,000 possible weight combinations)
- No information about which direction to improve
- Would take longer than the age of the universe

### 1.3 The Solution: Gradient Descent

**Key Insight**: The **gradient** tells us which direction to move to decrease the loss!

**Gradient** = Vector of partial derivatives with respect to each parameter
- Tells us how loss changes when we change each weight slightly
- Points in the direction of **steepest increase**
- We move in the **opposite direction** (steepest decrease)

**Gradient Descent Formula**:

$$

w_{new} = w_{old} - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial w}

$$

**Breaking down EVERY symbol:**

- $w_{new}$ = **New weight** value after the update
  - This is what we're calculating
  - Will replace $w_{old}$ in the next iteration
- $w_{old}$ = **Current weight** value before the update
  - This is where we are right now
  - Example: $w_{old} = 0.5$
- $=$ = **Assignment** (calculate right side, store in left side)
- $\alpha$ = **Learning rate** (Greek letter "alpha")
  - Controls how big each step is
  - Typical values: 0.001, 0.01, 0.1
  - If $\alpha = 0.01$ → take small, careful steps
  - If $\alpha = 0.5$ → take large, aggressive steps
  - **Too large**: Might overshoot and diverge (loss increases!)
  - **Too small**: Takes forever to converge
- $\cdot$ = **Multiplication** symbol
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w}$ = **Partial derivative** of loss with respect to weight
  - $\partial$ = Greek letter "del", means "partial derivative"
  - $L$ = Loss function (the error we're trying to minimize)
  - $\partial L$ = "tiny change in loss"
  - $\partial w$ = "tiny change in weight w"
  - $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w}$ = "how much does loss change per unit change in w?"
  - This is the **gradient** for weight w
  - Tells us the **direction and magnitude** to move

**What does the gradient tell us?**

- If $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w} = +2.0$:
  - Loss increases by 2 units when w increases by 1 unit
  - Loss is going UP as w goes UP
  - So we should DECREASE w (hence the minus sign!)
  - Update: $w_{new} = w_{old} - \alpha \cdot 2.0$
  
- If $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w} = -3.0$:
  - Loss decreases by 3 units when w increases by 1 unit
  - Loss is going DOWN as w goes UP
  - So we should INCREASE w
  - Update: $w_{new} = w_{old} - \alpha \cdot (-3.0) = w_{old} + 3\alpha$

- If $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w} = 0$:
  - Loss doesn't change when w changes
  - We're at a local minimum (or maximum or saddle point)
  - Don't update w (we've found an optimal point!)

**Concrete numerical example:**

Current state:
- $w_{old} = 0.5$
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w} = 2.0$ (loss increasing in positive w direction)
- $\alpha = 0.1$ (learning rate)

Update calculation:
- $w_{new} = 0.5 - 0.1 \times 2.0$
- $w_{new} = 0.5 - 0.2$
- $w_{new} = 0.3$

Result: Weight moved from 0.5 → 0.3 (decreased, which is correct since gradient was positive!)

**Why the negative sign?**
- Gradient points in direction of **steepest ascent** (uphill)
- We want to go **downhill** (minimize loss)
- So we subtract the gradient to go in the opposite direction
- This is why it's called "gradient **descent**" (going down)

Where:
- $w$ = weight parameter
- $\alpha$ = learning rate (step size)
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w}$ = gradient (how loss changes with w)

**Analogy**: Finding the lowest point in a valley
- You're blindfolded on a mountainside
- Gradient = slope of the ground under your feet
- Strategy: Always walk downhill (opposite of gradient)
- Eventually reach the valley floor (local minimum)

## 2. Calculus Refresher: Derivatives

### 2.1 What is a Derivative?

**Derivative** = Rate of change of a function

**Geometric Interpretation**: Slope of the tangent line

**Notation**:

$$

\frac{df}{dx} = f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}

$$

**Breaking down EVERY symbol:**

- $\frac{df}{dx}$ = **Derivative** of function f with respect to variable x
  - $d$ = "differential" (infinitesimally small change)
  - $df$ = "tiny change in f"
  - $dx$ = "tiny change in x"
  - $\frac{df}{dx}$ = "change in f per unit change in x"
  - Read as: "dee-eff dee-ex" or "derivative of f with respect to x"
  
- $f'(x)$ = **Alternative notation** for the derivative
  - Prime symbol (') means "derivative"
  - Pronounced "f prime of x"
  - More compact, common in math books
  
- $=$ = **Equals** (both notations mean the same thing)

- $\lim$ = **Limit** (mathematical limit)
  - Means "as we approach..."
  - The value the expression gets closer and closer to
  
- $h \to 0$ = **"h approaches zero"**
  - $h$ = small step size (like 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, ...)
  - $\to$ = "tends toward" or "approaches"
  - $h \to 0$ means h gets smaller: 0.1 → 0.01 → 0.001 → 0.0001 → ...
  - But h never actually equals zero (that would cause division by zero!)
  
- $\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$ = **Difference quotient** (slope calculation)
  - $f(x + h)$ = value of function at position $x + h$ (slightly to the right)
  - $f(x)$ = value of function at current position $x$
  - $f(x + h) - f(x)$ = **change in output** (rise)
  - $h$ = **change in input** (run)
  - $\frac{rise}{run}$ = **slope** of secant line
  
**What this formula means intuitively:**

Imagine you're on a hill at position x:
1. Take a tiny step forward (size h)
2. Measure how much height changed: $f(x+h) - f(x)$
3. Divide by step size h to get slope
4. Make step size infinitesimally small (h → 0)
5. This gives the exact slope at point x

**Concrete numerical example:**

Let's compute derivative of $f(x) = x^2$ at $x = 3$:

Step 1: Use h = 0.1 (not quite a limit yet)
- $f(3 + 0.1) = f(3.1) = 3.1^2 = 9.61$
- $f(3) = 3^2 = 9$
- $\frac{f(3.1) - f(3)}{0.1} = \frac{9.61 - 9}{0.1} = \frac{0.61}{0.1} = 6.1$

Step 2: Use h = 0.01 (smaller)
- $f(3.01) = 3.01^2 = 9.0601$
- $\frac{9.0601 - 9}{0.01} = \frac{0.0601}{0.01} = 6.01$

Step 3: Use h = 0.001 (even smaller)
- $f(3.001) = 3.001^2 = 9.006001$
- $\frac{9.006001 - 9}{0.001} = \frac{0.006001}{0.001} = 6.001$

As $h \to 0$, the value approaches **6.0** exactly!

This matches the derivative formula: $f'(x) = 2x$ → $f'(3) = 6$ ✓

**Example 1**: Linear function
```
f(x) = 3x + 2
f'(x) = 3

Interpretation: For every 1 unit increase in x, f increases by 3
```

**Example 2**: Quadratic function
```
f(x) = x²
f'(x) = 2x

At x=2: f'(2) = 4 (slope is 4)
At x=5: f'(5) = 10 (slope is 10)
```

### 2.2 Common Derivatives

| Function | Derivative |
|----------|-----------|
| $f(x) = c$ (constant) | $f'(x) = 0$ |
| $f(x) = x$ | $f'(x) = 1$ |
| $f(x) = x^n$ | $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$ |
| $f(x) = e^x$ | $f'(x) = e^x$ |
| $f(x) = \log(x)$ | $f'(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ |
| $f(x) = \sin(x)$ | $f'(x) = \cos(x)$ |

### 2.3 Derivative Rules

**Sum Rule**:

$$

(f + g)' = f' + g'

$$

**Product Rule**:

$$

(f \cdot g)' = f' \cdot g + f \cdot g'

$$

**Quotient Rule**:

$$

\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)' = \frac{f' \cdot g - f \cdot g'}{g^2}

$$

**Chain Rule** (most important for backprop!):

$$

\frac{d}{dx}f(g(x)) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)

$$

**Breaking down EVERY symbol:**

- $\frac{d}{dx}$ = **"Take derivative with respect to x"**
  - This is the operation we're performing
  - Means: "How does the following expression change as x changes?"
  
- $f(g(x))$ = **Composite function** (function of a function)
  - $g(x)$ = inner function (computed first)
  - $f(...)$ = outer function (applied to result of g)
  - Example: $f(u) = u^2$ and $g(x) = 3x + 1$ → $f(g(x)) = (3x+1)^2$
  - Read as: "f of g of x"
  
- $=$ = **Equals** (the derivative equals the right side)

- $f'(g(x))$ = **Derivative of outer function evaluated at inner function**
  - $f'$ = derivative of f with respect to its input
  - $(g(x))$ = but evaluate at $g(x)$, NOT at x directly
  - Example: If $f(u) = u^2$ then $f'(u) = 2u$ so $f'(g(x)) = 2g(x)$
  
- $\cdot$ = **Multiplication**

- $g'(x)$ = **Derivative of inner function with respect to x**
  - How fast is $g$ changing as $x$ changes?
  - Example: If $g(x) = 3x + 1$ then $g'(x) = 3$

**Alternative notation (Leibniz notation):**

$$

\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}

$$

Where:
- $u = g(x)$ (intermediate variable)
- $y = f(u)$ (final output)
- $\frac{dy}{du}$ = derivative of output w.r.t. intermediate = $f'(u)$
- $\frac{du}{dx}$ = derivative of intermediate w.r.t. input = $g'(x)$

**Why this works (intuitive):**

Think of derivatives as "sensitivity factors":
- $\frac{du}{dx}$ = "How sensitive is u to changes in x?"
- $\frac{dy}{du}$ = "How sensitive is y to changes in u?"
- $\frac{dy}{dx}$ = "How sensitive is y to changes in x?"

To get from x to y, changes must flow through u:
- Change x → affects u → affects y
- Total sensitivity = multiply the two sensitivities

**Concrete numerical example 1: Simple case**

Let $f(u) = u^2$ and $g(x) = 3x$, so $f(g(x)) = (3x)^2 = 9x^2$

Using chain rule:
- $f'(u) = 2u$ so $f'(g(x)) = 2(3x) = 6x$
- $g'(x) = 3$
- $\frac{d}{dx}f(g(x)) = 6x \cdot 3 = 18x$

Verify directly:
- $f(g(x)) = 9x^2$
- $\frac{d}{dx}(9x^2) = 18x$ ✓ **Matches!**

**Concrete numerical example 2: At a specific point**

Let $f(u) = e^u$ and $g(x) = x^2$, find derivative at $x = 2$

Step 1: Compute $g(2) = 2^2 = 4$

Step 2: Compute $f'(g(2)) = f'(4) = e^4 \approx 54.6$

Step 3: Compute $g'(2) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4$

Step 4: Multiply: $\frac{d}{dx}f(g(x))|_{x=2} = 54.6 \times 4 = 218.4$

**Why chain rule is crucial for backpropagation:**

Neural networks are giant compositions of functions:

$$

y = f_4(f_3(f_2(f_1(x))))

$$

To compute $\frac{dy}{dx}$, we use chain rule repeatedly:

$$

\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{df_4} \cdot \frac{df_4}{df_3} \cdot \frac{df_3}{df_2} \cdot \frac{df_2}{df_1} \cdot \frac{df_1}{dx}

$$

This is exactly what backpropagation does!

### 2.4 Partial Derivatives

For functions with multiple inputs: $f(x, y, z)$

**Partial derivative** with respect to $x$: $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$
- Treat other variables as constants
- Measures how $f$ changes when only $x$ changes

**Example**:
```
f(x, y) = x² + 3xy + y²

∂f/∂x = 2x + 3y  (derivative w.r.t. x, treat y as constant)
∂f/∂y = 3x + 2y  (derivative w.r.t. y, treat x as constant)
```

**Gradient** = Vector of all partial derivatives:

$$

\nabla f = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \\ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \end{bmatrix}

$$

---

## 3. The Chain Rule

### 3.1 Why Chain Rule?

Neural networks are **compositions of functions**:

$$

y = f_4(f_3(f_2(f_1(x))))

$$

To compute $\frac{dy}{dx}$, we need the **chain rule**.

### 3.2 Chain Rule Formula

For composite function $y = f(g(x))$:

$$

\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{dg} \cdot \frac{dg}{dx}

$$

**Example**:
```
Let y = (x² + 1)³

Set g(x) = x² + 1
Then y = f(g) = g³

Using chain rule:
dy/dx = dy/dg · dg/dx
      = 3g² · 2x
      = 3(x² + 1)² · 2x
      = 6x(x² + 1)²
```

### 3.3 Multi-Variable Chain Rule

For $z = f(x, y)$ where $x = g(t)$ and $y = h(t)$:

$$

\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \cdot \frac{dy}{dt}

$$

**Neural Network Example**:

```
Forward pass:
x → Linear → z → ReLU → a → Loss → L

Backward pass (chain rule):
∂L/∂x = (∂L/∂a) · (∂a/∂z) · (∂z/∂x)
```

### 3.4 Matrix Calculus

For matrix operations (like neural networks):

**Matrix-Vector Multiplication**: $z = Wx$

$$

\frac{\partial z_i}{\partial W_{jk}} = \begin{cases}
x_k & \text{if } i = j \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}

$$

**Simplified**:

$$

\frac{\partial z}{\partial W} = x^T \quad \text{(outer product)}

$$

$$

\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = W^T

$$

## 4. Computational Graphs

### 4.1 What is a Computational Graph?

A **computational graph** represents a sequence of operations as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

**Nodes** = Variables or operations
**Edges** = Data flow

### 4.2 Simple Example

**Expression**: $f(x, y) = (x + y) \cdot (x - y)$

**Computational Graph**:
```
     x ──┐
         ├──→ [+] ──→ a ──┐
     y ──┘                  ├──→ [×] ──→ f
                           │
     x ──┐                 │
         ├──→ [-] ──→ b ──┘
     y ──┘
```

**Forward Pass** (compute values):
```
Given x=3, y=2:
a = x + y = 5
b = x - y = 1
f = a × b = 5
```

**Backward Pass** (compute gradients):
```
∂f/∂f = 1 (base case)

∂f/∂a = ∂f/∂f · ∂f/∂a = 1 · b = 1 · 1 = 1
∂f/∂b = ∂f/∂f · ∂f/∂b = 1 · a = 1 · 5 = 5

∂f/∂x = ∂f/∂a · ∂a/∂x + ∂f/∂b · ∂b/∂x
      = 1 · 1 + 5 · 1 = 6

∂f/∂y = ∂f/∂a · ∂a/∂y + ∂f/∂b · ∂b/∂y
      = 1 · 1 + 5 · (-1) = -4
```

### 4.3 Neural Network Graph

**2-Layer Network**: $y = f_2(f_1(x, W_1), W_2)$

```
Input (x)
    ↓
  [W₁ @ x + b₁] ──→ z₁
    ↓
  [ReLU] ──→ a₁
    ↓
  [W₂ @ a₁ + b₂] ──→ z₂
    ↓
  [Softmax] ──→ ŷ
    ↓
  [Cross-Entropy] ──→ L
```

**Forward Pass**: Compute L given x
**Backward Pass**: Compute ∂L/∂W₁, ∂L/∂W₂, ∂L/∂b₁, ∂L/∂b₂

### 4.4 Why Graphs Matter

**Benefits**:
1. **Modularity**: Each operation is independent
2. **Automatic differentiation**: Apply chain rule systematically
3. **Efficiency**: Compute all gradients in one backward pass
4. **Optimization**: Framework can optimize computation order

**This is how PyTorch and TensorFlow work internally!**

---

## 5. Backpropagation Algorithm

### 5.1 The Core Idea

**Backpropagation** = Efficient algorithm to compute gradients using chain rule

**Key Insight**: 
- Forward pass: Compute outputs layer by layer (left to right)
- Backward pass: Compute gradients layer by layer (right to left)

**Why "Back" Propagation?**
- We propagate errors **backward** from output to input
- Start with loss gradient, work backward through the network

### 5.2 Algorithm Overview

**Step 1: Forward Pass**
- Compute and **cache** all intermediate values
- These are needed for gradient computation

**Step 2: Backward Pass**
- Start with $\frac{\partial L}{\partial L} = 1$
- For each layer (in reverse order):
  1. Receive gradient from next layer: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial a^{[l]}}$
  2. Compute local gradients: $\frac{\partial a^{[l]}}{\partial z^{[l]}}$, $\frac{\partial z^{[l]}}{\partial W^{[l]}}$
  3. Apply chain rule: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W^{[l]}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial a^{[l]}} \cdot \frac{\partial a^{[l]}}{\partial z^{[l]}} \cdot \frac{\partial z^{[l]}}{\partial W^{[l]}}$
  4. Pass gradient to previous layer: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial a^{[l-1]}}$

**Step 3: Update Weights**
- For each layer: $W^{[l]} := W^{[l]} - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial W^{[l]}}$

### 5.3 Detailed Example: 2-Layer Network

**Network**:
```
Input x (n₀) → [W₁, b₁] → z₁ (n₁) → ReLU → a₁ → [W₂, b₂] → z₂ (n₂) → Softmax → ŷ → Loss L
```

**Forward Pass**:
```python
# Layer 1
z1 = W1 @ x + b1      # (n₁, m) where m = batch size
a1 = ReLU(z1)         # (n₁, m)

# Layer 2
z2 = W2 @ a1 + b2     # (n₂, m)
y_hat = softmax(z2)   # (n₂, m)

# Loss
L = cross_entropy(y_true, y_hat)  # scalar
```

**Backward Pass**:

```python
# Gradient of loss w.r.t. output
dy_hat = y_hat - y_true  # (n₂, m)  [special property of softmax + cross-entropy]

# Layer 2 gradients
dz2 = dy_hat  # (n₂, m)
dW2 = (1/m) * dz2 @ a1.T  # (n₂, n₁)
db2 = (1/m) * np.sum(dz2, axis=1, keepdims=True)  # (n₂, 1)
da1 = W2.T @ dz2  # (n₁, m)

# Layer 1 gradients
dz1 = da1 * ReLU_derivative(z1)  # (n₁, m)  element-wise multiplication
dW1 = (1/m) * dz1 @ x.T  # (n₁, n₀)
db1 = (1/m) * np.sum(dz1, axis=1, keepdims=True)  # (n₁, 1)

# Update weights
W2 -= learning_rate * dW2
b2 -= learning_rate * db2
W1 -= learning_rate * dW1
b1 -= learning_rate * db1
```

### 5.4 Mathematical Derivations

**Layer $l$ with ReLU activation**:

**Forward**:

$$

z^{[l]} = W^{[l]} a^{[l-1]} + b^{[l]}

$$

**Breaking down EVERY symbol:**

- $z^{[l]}$ = **Pre-activation** (weighted sum) for layer l
  - $[l]$ = superscript indicating layer number (layer 1, layer 2, ...)
  - This is the value BEFORE applying activation function
  - Shape: $(n^{[l]}, m)$ where $n^{[l]}$ = neurons in layer l, m = batch size
  
- $=$ = **Assignment/computation**

- $W^{[l]}$ = **Weight matrix** for layer l
  - Shape: $(n^{[l]}, n^{[l-1]})$
  - $n^{[l]}$ = number of neurons in current layer
  - $n^{[l-1]}$ = number of neurons in previous layer
  - Each row corresponds to one neuron's weights
  
- $a^{[l-1]}$ = **Activation** from previous layer (layer l-1)
  - Output after applying activation function in previous layer
  - Shape: $(n^{[l-1]}, m)$
  - For first layer: $a^{[0]} = x$ (input data)
  
- $+$ = **Addition** (matrix addition)

- $b^{[l]}$ = **Bias vector** for layer l
  - Shape: $(n^{[l]}, 1)$
  - One bias per neuron in layer l
  - Broadcasted across batch dimension

**What this means:** Each neuron computes a weighted sum of previous layer's outputs plus a bias

$$

a^{[l]} = \text{ReLU}(z^{[l]})

$$

**Breaking down:**

- $a^{[l]}$ = **Activation** (output) for layer l
  - This is the value AFTER applying activation function
  - What gets passed to next layer
  
- $=$ = **Assignment**

- $\text{ReLU}(z^{[l]})$ = **ReLU activation function** applied to pre-activation
  - $\text{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z)$ for each element
  - Introduces non-linearity

**Backward**:

1. **Gradient w.r.t. pre-activation**:

$$

\frac{\partial L}{\partial z^{[l]}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial a^{[l]}} \odot \text{ReLU}'(z^{[l]})

$$

**Breaking down EVERY symbol:**

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z^{[l]}}$ = **Gradient of loss with respect to pre-activation**
  - This tells us: "How does loss change when $z^{[l]}$ changes?"
  - Shape: Same as $z^{[l]}$ → $(n^{[l]}, m)$
  - This is what we're calculating
  
- $=$ = **Equals**

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial a^{[l]}}$ = **Gradient of loss w.r.t. activation**
  - We already have this from the next layer (backpropagation flows backward!)
  - Shape: $(n^{[l]}, m)$
  - Tells us how loss changes when activation changes
  
- $\odot$ = **Hadamard product** (element-wise multiplication)
  - Multiply corresponding elements: $[a, b] \odot [c, d] = [a \times c, b \times d]$
  - NOT matrix multiplication (@)
  - Both matrices must have same shape
  
- $\text{ReLU}'(z^{[l]})$ = **Derivative of ReLU** evaluated at $z^{[l]}$
  - $\text{ReLU}'(z) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } z > 0 \\ 0 & \text{if } z \leq 0 \end{cases}$
  - Binary mask: 1 where $z > 0$, 0 elsewhere
  - This "gates" the gradient flow
  
**Why this works:** Chain rule! 

$$L \to a^{[l]} \to z^{[l]}$$ 
so 

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial z^{[l]}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial a^{[l]}} \cdot \frac{\partial a^{[l]}}{\partial z^{[l]}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial a^{[l]}} \cdot \text{ReLU}'(z^{[l]})$$

**Concrete example:**
```
z^{[l]} = [[-2.0, 0.5],
           [ 3.0, -1.0]]

ReLU'(z^{[l]}) = [[0, 1],    # Mask: 0 where z≤0, 1 where z>0
                  [1, 0]]

∂L/∂a^{[l]} = [[0.3, 0.5],   # From next layer
               [0.2, 0.8]]

∂L/∂z^{[l]} = [[0.3, 0.5],   # Element-wise multiply
               [0.2, 0.8]] ⊙ [[0, 1],
                              [1, 0]]
            = [[0.0, 0.5],   # Gradient blocked where z≤0!
               [0.2, 0.0]]
```

where $\odot$ is element-wise multiplication

2. **Gradient w.r.t. weights**:

$$

\frac{\partial L}{\partial W^{[l]}} = \frac{1}{m} \frac{\partial L}{\partial z^{[l]}} (a^{[l-1]})^T

$$

**Breaking down EVERY symbol:**

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W^{[l]}}$ = **Gradient of loss w.r.t. weights**
  - How much should we adjust each weight to reduce loss?
  - Shape: Same as $W^{[l]}$ → $(n^{[l]}, n^{[l-1]})$
  - Used to update weights: $W^{[l]} := W^{[l]} - \alpha \frac{\partial L}{\partial W^{[l]}}$
  
- $=$ = **Equals**

- $\frac{1}{m}$ = **Average over batch**
  - $m$ = batch size (number of samples)
  - Dividing makes gradient independent of batch size
  - Ensures consistent learning regardless of batch size
  
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z^{[l]}}$ = **Gradient w.r.t. pre-activation**
  - We just computed this in step 1!
  - Shape: $(n^{[l]}, m)$
  
- $(a^{[l-1]})^T$ = **Transpose of previous layer's activation**
  - $a^{[l-1]}$ has shape $(n^{[l-1]}, m)$
  - Transpose flips it to $(m, n^{[l-1]})$
  - $T$ superscript means transpose
  
- Matrix multiplication: $(n^{[l]}, m) @ (m, n^{[l-1]}) = (n^{[l]}, n^{[l-1]})$ ✓ Correct shape!

**Why this works:** Weight $W^{[l]}_{ij}$ connects neuron j in layer l-1 to neuron i in layer l. The gradient is:

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial W^{[l]}_{ij}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z^{[l]}_i} \cdot a^{[l-1]}_j$$

Summed over all samples in the batch, then averaged by $\frac{1}{m}$.

**Concrete numerical example:**
```
∂L/∂z^{[l]} = [[0.2, 0.3],   # Shape: (2, 2) - 2 neurons, 2 samples
               [0.1, 0.4]]

a^{[l-1]} = [[1.0, 2.0],      # Shape: (3, 2) - 3 neurons, 2 samples
             [0.5, 1.5],
             [0.0, 1.0]]

(a^{[l-1]})^T = [[1.0, 0.5, 0.0],   # Transpose → Shape: (2, 3)
                 [2.0, 1.5, 1.0]]

∂L/∂W^{[l]} = (1/2) × [[0.2, 0.3],  @ [[1.0, 0.5, 0.0],
                        [0.1, 0.4]]     [2.0, 1.5, 1.0]]

            = (1/2) × [[0.2×1.0 + 0.3×2.0,  0.2×0.5 + 0.3×1.5,  0.2×0.0 + 0.3×1.0],
                       [0.1×1.0 + 0.4×2.0,  0.1×0.5 + 0.4×1.5,  0.1×0.0 + 0.4×1.0]]
                       
            = (1/2) × [[0.8, 0.55, 0.3],
                       [0.9, 0.65, 0.4]]
                       
            = [[0.4, 0.275, 0.15],   # Final gradient! Shape: (2, 3) ✓
               [0.45, 0.325, 0.2]]
```

3. **Gradient w.r.t. bias**:

$$

\frac{\partial L}{\partial b^{[l]}} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_i \frac{\partial L}{\partial z^{[l]}_i}

$$

**Breaking down EVERY symbol:**

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial b^{[l]}}$ = **Gradient of loss w.r.t. bias**
  - How much to adjust each bias?
  - Shape: $(n^{[l]}, 1)$ - one gradient per neuron
  
- $=$ = **Equals**

- $\frac{1}{m}$ = **Average over batch** (m = batch size)

- $\sum_i$ = **Sum over all samples** in the batch
  - $i$ = sample index (goes from 1 to m)
  - Sum across columns (axis=1 in NumPy)
  
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z^{[l]}_i}$ = **Gradient w.r.t. pre-activation for sample i**
  - Just the i-th column of $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z^{[l]}}$

**Why this works:** Bias $b^{[l]}_j$ adds to neuron j for ALL samples. So gradient is sum of individual sample gradients.

**Concrete example:**
```
∂L/∂z^{[l]} = [[0.2, 0.3, 0.1],   # Shape: (2, 3) - 2 neurons, 3 samples
               [0.1, 0.4, 0.2]]

∂L/∂b^{[l]} = (1/3) × [[0.2 + 0.3 + 0.1],   # Sum across samples
                       [0.1 + 0.4 + 0.2]]
                       
            = (1/3) × [[0.6],
                       [0.7]]
                       
            = [[0.2],   # Shape: (2, 1) ✓
               [0.233]]
```

4. **Gradient to previous layer**:

$$

\frac{\partial L}{\partial a^{[l-1]}} = (W^{[l]})^T \frac{\partial L}{\partial z^{[l]}}

$$

**Breaking down EVERY symbol:**

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial a^{[l-1]}}$ = **Gradient w.r.t. previous layer's activation**
  - This is what we pass BACKWARD to the previous layer
  - Shape: $(n^{[l-1]}, m)$
  - Previous layer will use this to compute its own gradients
  
- $=$ = **Equals**

- $(W^{[l]})^T$ = **Transpose of weight matrix**
  - $W^{[l]}$ has shape $(n^{[l]}, n^{[l-1]})$
  - Transpose flips to $(n^{[l-1]}, n^{[l]})$
  
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z^{[l]}}$ = **Gradient w.r.t. current pre-activation**
  - Shape: $(n^{[l]}, m)$
  
- Matrix multiplication: $(n^{[l-1]}, n^{[l]}) @ (n^{[l]}, m) = (n^{[l-1]}, m)$ ✓ Correct!

**Why this works:** Activation $a^{[l-1]}_j$ flows through ALL weights in column j of $W^{[l]}$, affecting all neurons in layer l. We sum contributions from all downstream neurons.

**Concrete example:**
```
W^{[l]} = [[0.5, 0.2, 0.1],   # Shape: (2, 3)
           [0.3, 0.4, 0.6]]

(W^{[l]})^T = [[0.5, 0.3],     # Transpose → Shape: (3, 2)
               [0.2, 0.4],
               [0.1, 0.6]]

∂L/∂z^{[l]} = [[0.2, 0.3],     # Shape: (2, 2)
               [0.1, 0.4]]

∂L/∂a^{[l-1]} = [[0.5, 0.3],  @ [[0.2, 0.3],
                 [0.2, 0.4],     [0.1, 0.4]]
                 [0.1, 0.6]]

              = [[0.5×0.2 + 0.3×0.1,  0.5×0.3 + 0.3×0.4],
                 [0.2×0.2 + 0.4×0.1,  0.2×0.3 + 0.4×0.4],
                 [0.1×0.2 + 0.6×0.1,  0.1×0.3 + 0.6×0.4]]
                 
              = [[0.13, 0.27],   # Shape: (3, 2) ✓
                 [0.08, 0.22],   # Pass this to layer l-1!
                 [0.08, 0.27]]
```

### 5.5 Special Case: Softmax + Cross-Entropy

**Forward**:

$$

\hat{y} = \text{softmax}(z) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_j e^{z_j}}

$$

$$
L = -\sum_i y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)

$$

**Backward** (simplified gradient):

$$

\frac{\partial L}{\partial z} = \hat{y} - y

$$

**Breaking down EVERY symbol:**

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z}$ = **Gradient of loss w.r.t. pre-activation (logits)**
  - $z$ = output of final layer BEFORE softmax
  - Called "logits" in classification
  - Shape: $(K, m)$ where K = number of classes, m = batch size
  - This is what we use to backpropagate through earlier layers
  
- $=$ = **Equals** (this is the remarkably simple result!)

- $\hat{y}$ = **Predicted probabilities** (output of softmax)
  - Shape: $(K, m)$
  - Each column sums to 1 (probabilities for one sample)
  - Example: $[0.7, 0.2, 0.1]^T$ means 70% confident class 0, 20% class 1, 10% class 2
  
- $-$ = **Subtraction** (element-wise)

- $y$ = **True labels** (one-hot encoded)
  - Shape: $(K, m)$
  - Each column has one 1 and rest 0s
  - Example: $[0, 1, 0]^T$ means true class is 1
  
**Why this is AMAZING:**

Normally, computing $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z}$ requires chain rule through two steps:
1. Derivative of cross-entropy w.r.t. softmax output
2. Derivative of softmax w.r.t. its input

Both are complex! But when combined, they magically simplify to just $\hat{y} - y$!

**The full derivation** (you can skip, but it's beautiful):

Softmax: $\hat{y}_i = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_j e^{z_j}}$

Cross-entropy: $L = -\sum_k y_k \log(\hat{y}_k)$

Using chain rule: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_i} = \sum_k \frac{\partial L}{\partial \hat{y}_k} \frac{\partial \hat{y}_k}{\partial z_i}$

After lots of algebra... → $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_i} = \hat{y}_i - y_i$ ✓

**Concrete numerical example:**

Say we have 3 classes and 1 sample:

True label: class 1 (0-indexed)
- $y = [0, 1, 0]^T$ (one-hot)

Model prediction after softmax:
- $\hat{y} = [0.2, 0.7, 0.1]^T$

Gradient:
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z} = \hat{y} - y = [0.2, 0.7, 0.1]^T - [0, 1, 0]^T = [0.2, -0.3, 0.1]^T$

**Interpretation:**
- Class 0: gradient = +0.2 → predicted too high (20% vs 0%), decrease z₀
- Class 1: gradient = -0.3 → predicted too low (70% vs 100%), increase z₁
- Class 2: gradient = +0.1 → predicted too high (10% vs 0%), decrease z₂

**If model was more confident and CORRECT:**
- $\hat{y} = [0.05, 0.90, 0.05]^T$
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z} = [0.05, -0.10, 0.05]^T$ (smaller gradients = less to learn)

**If model was confident but WRONG:**
- True: class 1, Predicted: $\hat{y} = [0.1, 0.1, 0.8]^T$ (thinks it's class 2!)
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z} = [0.1, -0.9, 0.8]^T$ (huge gradients = big correction needed!)

**Why this formula is elegant:**
- If prediction matches truth: $\hat{y}_i = y_i$ → gradient = 0 (perfect, no update)
- If wrong: gradient is proportional to error
- Automatically handles multi-class without loops
- Numerically stable

This elegant result makes training classification networks very efficient!

## 6. Gradient Descent

### 6.1 Batch Gradient Descent

**Compute gradient using ALL training samples**:

$$

W := W - \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \nabla_W L(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})

$$

**Pros**:
- Stable convergence (smooth gradient)
- Guaranteed to converge to local minimum (for convex functions)

**Cons**:
- Very slow for large datasets
- Requires all data in memory
- No online learning

### 6.2 Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

**Update weights using ONE sample at a time**:

$$

W := W - \alpha \cdot \nabla_W L(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})

$$

**Pros**:
- Very fast updates
- Can escape shallow local minima (noise helps)
- Enables online learning

**Cons**:
- Noisy gradients (high variance)
- May not converge to exact minimum
- Requires learning rate decay

### 6.3 Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

**Best of both worlds: Use batches of size 32-256**:

$$

W := W - \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{b} \sum_{i \in \text{batch}} \nabla_W L(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})

$$

**Pros**:
- Efficient on GPUs (parallelization)
- Balanced gradient estimates
- Faster convergence than SGD

**Common batch sizes**: 32, 64, 128, 256

**This is the standard in practice!**

### 6.4 Learning Rate

**The most important hyperparameter!**

**Too small**: $\alpha = 0.00001$
- Converges very slowly
- May get stuck in local minimum

**Too large**: $\alpha = 10$
- Overshoots minimum
- Loss oscillates or diverges

**Just right**: $\alpha = 0.001$ to $0.01$
- Steady decrease in loss
- Reaches good solution

**Learning Rate Schedule**:
- Start with higher learning rate
- Decrease over time (e.g., divide by 10 every N epochs)

---

## 7. Backpropagation Through Layers

### 7.1 Dense Layer Backprop

**Forward**:
```python
Z = W @ A_prev + b
A = activation(Z)
```

**Backward**:
```python
dZ = dA * activation_derivative(Z)
dW = (1/m) * dZ @ A_prev.T
db = (1/m) * np.sum(dZ, axis=1, keepdims=True)
dA_prev = W.T @ dZ
```

### 7.2 Activation Function Backprop

**ReLU**:
```python
# Forward
A = np.maximum(0, Z)

# Backward
dZ = dA * (Z > 0)  # Gradient is 0 where Z ≤ 0, else 1
```

**Sigmoid**:
```python
# Forward
A = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-Z))

# Backward
dZ = dA * A * (1 - A)
```

**Tanh**:
```python
# Forward
A = np.tanh(Z)

# Backward
dZ = dA * (1 - A**2)
```

### 7.3 Loss Function Backprop

**Categorical Cross-Entropy + Softmax**:
```python
# Forward
A = softmax(Z)
L = -np.sum(Y * np.log(A)) / m

# Backward (combined gradient)
dZ = A - Y  # Elegant simplification!
```

## 8. Vanishing & Exploding Gradients

### 8.1 The Problem

**Vanishing Gradients**:
- Gradients become extremely small as they propagate backward
- Early layers learn very slowly or not at all
- Network effectively becomes shallow

**Exploding Gradients**:
- Gradients become extremely large
- Weights blow up to infinity
- Training becomes unstable (NaN values)

### 8.2 Why This Happens

**Chain Rule Multiplication**:

$$

\frac{\partial L}{\partial W^{[1]}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z^{[L]}} \cdot \frac{\partial z^{[L]}}{\partial z^{[L-1]}} \cdot ... \cdot \frac{\partial z^{[2]}}{\partial W^{[1]}}

$$

If each term is <1: Product → 0 (vanishing)
If each term is >1: Product → ∞ (exploding)

**Sigmoid Problem**:
- Sigmoid derivative max = 0.25
- For 10 layers: 0.25^10 = 0.0000009 (gradient vanishes!)

### 8.3 Solutions

1. **Use ReLU** (gradient is 1 for positive values)
2. **Batch Normalization** (normalize layer inputs)
3. **Residual Connections** (skip connections, covered in Chapter 06)
4. **Gradient Clipping** (cap gradient magnitude)
5. **Proper Weight Initialization** (Xavier, He initialization)

---

## 9. Automatic Differentiation

### 9.1 What is Autograd?

**Automatic differentiation** (autodiff) = System that automatically computes derivatives

**How PyTorch/TensorFlow work**:
1. Build computational graph during forward pass
2. Automatically compute gradients during backward pass
3. User never writes derivative code!

### 9.2 Forward Mode vs Reverse Mode

**Forward Mode**:
- Compute derivatives forward with the function
- Efficient when outputs >> inputs

**Reverse Mode** (what neural networks use):
- Compute derivatives backward from output
- Efficient when inputs >> outputs
- This is backpropagation!

### 9.3 Building a Simple Autograd

**Core Idea**: Each operation stores:
1. Input values
2. How to compute local gradient
3. References to parent nodes

```python
class Value:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.grad = 0
        self._backward = lambda: None
        self._prev = set()
    
    def backward(self):
        # Topological sort of graph
        # Call _backward() for each node in reverse order
        pass
```

**Example**:
```python
a = Value(2.0)
b = Value(3.0)
c = a * b  # c.data = 6.0

c.grad = 1.0
c.backward()

print(a.grad)  # 3.0 (∂c/∂a = b)
print(b.grad)  # 2.0 (∂c/∂b = a)
```

### 10.2 Testing Gradients

**Gradient Checking**: Verify analytical gradients with numerical approximation

$$

\frac{\partial L}{\partial w} \approx \frac{L(w + \epsilon) - L(w - \epsilon)}{2\epsilon}

$$

where $\epsilon = 10^{-7}$

**Relative Error**:

$$

\text{error} = \frac{||\text{grad}_\text{analytical} - \text{grad}_\text{numerical}||}{||\text{grad}_\text{analytical}|| + ||\text{grad}_\text{numerical}||}

$$

Should be < $10^{-7}$ for correct implementation
